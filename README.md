## About the Project

This project was developed as part of the TripleTen bootcamp to enhance skills in **responsive web design**, going beyond the minimum requirements proposed. Using **CSS3 media queries**, the interface adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** → Semantic and accessible structure.
- **CSS3** → Responsiveness techniques with *media queries*, flexbox, and grid.
- **Git & GitHub** → Version control and deployment on GitHub Pages.

## Features Learned and Applied

- **Responsiveness:** Adjusting layout for different devices with *media queries*.
- **Flexbox and CSS Grid:** Combining these techniques for greater layout control.
- **Relative Dimensions:** Using percentages for *margins*, *padding*, and *font-size*.
  
## Project Objective

The main objective was to consolidate skills in **responsive design**, flexbox, and grid, creating a scalable website that adapts easily to different devices. Additionally, best practices in version control with **Git branching** were explored.

## Key Differentiators

This project went beyond the original TripleTen challenge, which only required semantic HTML and flexbox. As a differentiator, advanced responsiveness techniques were incorporated, including **CSS Grid**.

## Deployment

The project is available online via GitHub Pages: (https://mayzamendesrodrigues.github.io/aprendendo_aprender/)
