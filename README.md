## About the Project

This project was developed as part of the **TripleTen** bootcamp to enhance skills in **responsive design**, going beyond the minimum requirements. Using **CSS3 media queries**, the interface adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** → Semantic and accessible structure.
- **CSS3** → Responsiveness techniques with *media queries*, flexbox, and grid.
- **Git & GitHub** → Version control and deployment on GitHub Pages.

## Features Learned and Applied

- **Responsiveness:** Adjusting the layout for different devices with *media queries*.
- **Flexbox and CSS Grid:** Combining these techniques for greater layout control.
- **Relative Dimensions:** Using percentages for *margins*, *padding*, and *font-size*.

## Project Objective

The main objective was to consolidate skills in **responsive design**, flexbox, and grid, creating a scalable website that easily adapts to different devices. Additionally, best practices in version control with **Git branching** were explored.

## Key Differentiators

This project went beyond the original TripleTen challenge, which required only semantic HTML and flexbox. As a differentiator, advanced responsiveness techniques, including **CSS Grid**, were incorporated.

Continuing the challenge, this second phase enhanced the project with new advanced CSS and HTML techniques, going beyond the minimum requirements. The goal was to deepen knowledge in **animations, element positioning, and interactivity**, elevating the user experience.

## Technologies and Techniques Applied

- **Keyframe Animation** → Creating smooth animations to improve interface dynamics.
- **Iframe** → Integrating external content in a responsive and secure way.
- **Position (Relative, Absolute)** → Precise control over element placement on the page.
- **Negative Margin** → Fine-tuning the layout for overlap and visual alignment.

## Additional Implementations

- **Keyframe Animations:** Applied transitions to make navigation more fluid and visually appealing.
- **Iframe Integration:** Embedded videos and external content without compromising responsiveness.
- **Strategic Positioning Usage:** Organized elements to create a harmonious and modern composition.
- **Negative Margin Adjustments:** Optimized space usage and improved page flow.

## Expansion Objective

The purpose of this phase was to refine the design and interactivity of the project, consolidating advanced knowledge in **CSS and HTML** and preparing a more robust foundation for future implementations.
